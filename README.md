# This repository is meant to be used as a general collection of fortran/python/bash/etc scripts that can be useful for others in the lab. 

They might be written in a very tailored way specifically addressing ones purpose but for best practice it would be useful to provide scripts that are as **general** as possible. 

This idea comes from avoiding code redundancy and useless work (e.g the mutational clustering task which we have now 4 different scripts doing essentially more or less the same)

As a general guideline please document and generalize as much as possible code before deposition.
Those scripts that will be used a lot in the future might require better documentation/thought than those that are very specific.

If anyone wants to contribute / add some comments feel free to edit this README.md file or lets discuss it during coffeebreaks.

Ϟ See you guys in the office Ϟ
